1. **Edit Your Community:** Managing your community is a breeze on Blep. Simply navigate to your community's page and locate the 'Edit' button at the top. Clicking on this button opens up a world of customization options.
2. **Update Community Photo:** First impressions matter, and your community's photo plays a big role. With Blep, you can easily update your community's profile picture to reflect its identity and purpose. Showcase your community's uniqueness with a captivating image that resonates with your members.
3. **Control Event Posting:** Decide who has the privilege to post events in your community. You have the flexibility to choose between two options:
   * **Admin Only:** If you prefer to maintain full control over event postings, you can limit event creation to administrators or community owners.
   * **Anyone:** Alternatively, you can open event posting to all community members, fostering engagement and collaboration within your community.
4. **Manage Privacy:** Your community's privacy settings are within your grasp. Blep allows you to switch between public and private modes as needed. Keep your community accessible to the broader public, or make it a private, exclusive spaceâ€”whenever it suits your community's goals.
5. **Effortless Member Management:** Handling your community members is a simple process on Blep. In the members list screen, locate the three dots ('...') next to each member's name. Clicking on these dots opens a range of management options:
   * **Make Them a Moderator:** Elevate trusted members to moderators, empowering them to help maintain a positive community environment.
   * **Block Members:** When necessary, you can block members who violate community guidelines or engage in inappropriate behavior.
   * **Remove Members:** For more serious cases, you have the ability to remove members from the community entirely, ensuring the community remains a welcoming space.

Blep puts the power of community management in your hands, enabling you to shape and nurture your community according to your vision and objectives. With these straightforward steps, you can effortlessly customize, moderate, and grow your community with ease."
