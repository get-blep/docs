# Share

By sharing communities, Blep users facilitate a network effect, where communities grow and flourish as more individuals with shared passions and interests join in. This feature promotes the organic growth of communities and encourages the formation of new connections.

Sharing your community is a straightforward process. Simply navigate to the community page and click on the 'Invite Friends' button.

**Diverse Sharing Options:**

Upon clicking 'Invite Friends,' you'll be directed to a share screen that offers multiple options for sharing:

* **Generate QR Code:** You can generate a QR code representing your community, making it easy for others to scan and join.
* **Copy Joining Link:** Copy the unique community joining link to your clipboard and share it through messaging apps, emails, or other communication channels.
* **Share on Social Platforms:** Take advantage of seamless integration with popular platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, and more. Share your community with your existing network and beyond.

Blep's 'Sharing' feature is a testament to our commitment to fostering connections and expanding horizons. It's a tool that empowers users to bring people together, discover new communities, and strengthen the bonds within their existing networks. Share, connect, and watch your community thrive.
