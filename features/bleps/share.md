# Share

Just like communities, sharing Bleps is a fantastic way to connect with others and expand your network. Whether you've created a Blep or are excited about one you're planning to attend, sharing the magic of your upcoming meetup is a breeze on Blep.

### **Sharing Steps**

1.  **Find the Share Button**

    To start sharing your Blep, visit the Blep's dedicated page. Look for the 'Share' button, which is your gateway to introducing others to your unique meetup.
2.  **Choose Your Sharing Method**

    Once you've located the 'Share' button, you'll have a variety of options to spread the word about your Blep, just like you would for a community:

    * **Generate QR Code:** Create a QR code that represents your Blep, making it convenient for others to scan and join.
    * **Copy Joining Link:** Copy the exclusive joining link to your clipboard, allowing you to easily share it via messaging apps, emails, or any other communication channel.
    * **Social Share Features:** Blep seamlessly integrates with popular social platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, and more. Use these features to share your Blep with your existing network and beyond.

Sharing Bleps goes beyond merely promoting an event; it's about creating connections, building anticipation, and inviting others to be part of a memorable experience. Just like the magic of a Blep meetup, the power of sharing can help your Blep grow and flourish.
