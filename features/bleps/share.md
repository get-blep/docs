# Share

Much like communities, sharing Bleps serves as a splendid avenue to connect with others and broaden your network. Whether you've crafted a Blep or are enthusiastic about one you intend to attend, disseminating the allure of your impending meetup is a straightforward task on Blep.

### 1. Find the Share Button

To commence the sharing of your Blep, visit the Blep's dedicated page. Seek out the 'Share' button, which serves as your portal to acquainting others with your distinct meetup.

### 2. Choose Your Sharing Method

Once you've located the 'Share' button, a plethora of options become available for disseminating information about your Blep, akin to how you would for a community:

*   **Generate QR Code**

    Generate a QR code that represents your Blep, streamlining the process for others to scan and join.
*   **Copy Joining Link**

    Duplicate the exclusive joining link to your clipboard, facilitating seamless sharing via messaging applications, emails, or any alternative communication channel.

### 3. Social Share Features

Blep effortlessly integrates with prominent social platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, and more. Harness these features to disseminate information about your Blep within your existing network and beyond.

Sharing Bleps transcends the mere promotion of an event; it's about cultivating connections, nurturing anticipation, and inviting others to partake in a remarkable experience. Much akin to the enchantment of a Blep meetup, the act of sharing possesses the potential to contribute to the growth and flourishing of your Blep.
