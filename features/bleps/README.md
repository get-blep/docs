# ü§ù Bleps

At Blep, we understand that every in-real-life (IRL) meet or networking session is a unique and memorable experience. That's why we've introduced 'Bleps,' where each meet is infused with a touch of magic.

### **Craft Your Special Meetup**

Once you've joined a community, you have the option to either create your own Blep or join existing ones. Bleps are your gateway to hosting and participating in extraordinary IRL meetups that align with your interests and passions.

### **Tailor the Experience**

When creating your Blep, you have the freedom to customize the event to your liking. Specify essential details such as the meetup's location, date, and time. This ensures that your meetup is perfectly timed and located for convenience.

### **Manage the Guest List**

Control the dynamics of your meetup by setting the maximum number of members allowed to attend. Whether you're planning an intimate gathering or a larger event, you can shape the meetup to suit your vision.

### **Entry Fees with a Twist**

Add an extra layer of exclusivity or incentive by setting entry fees. You can choose whether attendees pay with Blep tokens or specific NFTs. This unique feature not only adds value to your event but also introduces a layer of excitement.

Bleps are more than just meetups; they're magical experiences where you can gather with like-minded individuals who share your passions and interests. Whether you're hosting or joining, Bleps are your ticket to special IRL meets that are nothing short of extraordinary.
