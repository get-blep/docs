To embark on the creation of your Blep, follow a process akin to community creation. You can access the 'Create Blep' option by either clicking the floating '+' button or navigating through the hamburger menu at the top.

### 2. Provide Basic Information

Your Blep's foundation rests upon its particulars. Initiate the process by furnishing essential information, which includes an enticing title, a succinct description, the meetup's schedule, and the designated location. These details establish the groundwork for an unforgettable event.

### 3. Set Attendee Limit

Tailor the ambiance of your Blep by defining the maximum number of participants permissible. Whether you lean towards an intimate gathering or aspire to host a larger event, you wield the flexibility to configure your meetup in alignment with your vision.

### 4. Entry Fees for Augmented Value

Should you desire, you can introduce an additional layer of exclusivity or motivation by implementing entry fees. Clearly outline whether attendees should remit payments using Blep tokens or alternative tokens, or if specific NFTs are required. This distinctive feature not only enhances the event's worth but also introduces an element of anticipation.

### 5. Congratulations, You're Ready

Having successfully completed these straightforward steps, you have now crafted your inaugural Blep. Congratulations! Your event is primed to connect individuals, nurture meaningful interactions, and etch enduring memories.
